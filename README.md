# Spatial-Temporal Mapping of Forest Vegetation Cover Changes Along Highways in Brunei Using Deep Learning Techniques and Sentinel-2 Images  
This is the repository for the experiment done to map forest cover changes along the Telisai-Lumut highway whose article has been submitted for publication.
The datasets folder contains two folders; 
# 1. Raw images folder containing images and their corresponding masks and 2. 128_pacthes containing the patched images and masks for deep learning training.
# The create-patches file shows how the patches wewre generated for network training
#The remaining files are for the U-Net training and the Deeplabv3+
